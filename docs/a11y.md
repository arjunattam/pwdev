# Accessibility testing with Playwright [WIP]

Why
* native input events

Common issues
* Unable to read
  * Incorrect screen reader (VoiceOver) behavior
    * Focus landing on wrong element
    * Focus order is incorrect
  * Missing alt-text (static violations)
* Unable to interact
  * Enter to click a link
  * Left/right to select options
  * Form interactions: checkbox space
* Special elements
  * Auto completion
  * Date picker
    * https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/examples/widgets/datepicker/

Recommended patterns
* Autofocus or not
  * Google has auto-focus
  * most blind users always intuitively press Ctrl + Home first ("Auto focus workaround")

Techniques to solving
* Static violations detection with Axe (check for semantics?)
  * Alt-text
  * Contrast
  * Full list: https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.5
* Full website violations (https://github.com/JakePartusch/lumberjack)
* Tab stops
  * After page load
  * Tab after a specific active element
* Accessibility tree
* Shadow DOM testing
* Aria live regions
  * Can I test assertive / polite announcement?

Other approaches
* Press tab to check all interactive elements are covered
  * Including "fake buttons (div)"
* Roving tabindex for custom components

Limitations
* Regressions â€“ and not exploratory
  * How to avoid? Always define behavior if current element is in focus?

Notes
* What does "swipe left" do in VO?

* Aria role=application
